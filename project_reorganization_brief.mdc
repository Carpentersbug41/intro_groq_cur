# Project Reorganization Brief for LLM

## Current State:
The current project structure suffers from inconsistencies and lacks clear organization. Specifically:
- File names are not consistently named following a clear convention.
- Folder names are sometimes unclear or do not accurately reflect their contents.
- Some files are located in folders where they don't logically belong.
- The overall directory structure could be improved for better clarity and maintainability.

## Desired Outcome:
A well-organized project structure with:
- Consistent and descriptive file and folder naming conventions.
- A logical folder hierarchy that groups related files effectively.
- Improved discoverability and maintainability of project components.

## Task for LLM:
1.  **Analyze:** Examine the current file and folder structure of the project.
2.  **Propose:** Suggest a revised, more logical directory structure.
3.  **Rename:** Recommend new, consistent names for files and folders where necessary.
4.  **Relocate:** Identify files that should be moved to different folders for better organization.
5.  **Execute (Optional/If Possible):** Outline the steps (e.g., terminal commands, file operations) required to implement the proposed reorganization, or apply the changes directly if feasible within your capabilities.

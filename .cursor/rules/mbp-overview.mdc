# IELTS Opinion Essay Main Body Paragraphs – Prompt Sequence & Formula

## 1. Overview

This document defines the **structure, rules, and prompt sequence** for practicing and evaluating main body (supporting) paragraphs in IELTS Opinion Essays. It is designed for use in the chat-based prompt system, following the conventions in `prompt-format.mdc` and the macro structure in `phase.mdc`.

## 2. Band 9 Main Body Paragraph Formula

Every main body paragraph should contain:

1. **Topic Sentence**
   - Clearly states the main idea of the paragraph (directly answers the question).
   - Paraphrases the main idea from the introduction (not the exact same words).
   - Short, clear, and directly relevant.

2. **Explanation Sentences**
   - 2–4 sentences that explain the topic sentence.
   - Answer “why?”, “how?”, “what’s the result?” for the main idea.
   - Should be clear, logical, and detailed enough for a reader with no background knowledge.

3. **Example Sentence**
   - Provides evidence to support the main idea.
   - Preferably a real, general example (not a personal anecdote).
   - If a personal example is used, it should be generalized (e.g., “Many people in my country…” instead of “I…”).

**Formula:**

[Topic Sentence] + [Explanation(s)] + [Example]

## 3. Key Rules and Criteria

### Content Rules

- **No more than two main ideas per paragraph** (usually just one).
- **Each paragraph = one main idea, fully developed**.
- **No “firstly, secondly, thirdly, finally” lists**—avoid listing multiple ideas without development.
- **Each main idea must be explained and supported** (not just stated).
- **Examples should be real and general, not personal or made-up statistics.**
- **Grammar and vocabulary must be clear and accurate** (not perfect, but must not obscure meaning).

### Band 9 Checklist

- Ideas are **relevant** (directly answer the question).
- **All parts of the task** are addressed (e.g., both questions in a double question).
- **Clear position** is maintained throughout.
- **Ideas are fully extended and well supported** (with explanations and examples).

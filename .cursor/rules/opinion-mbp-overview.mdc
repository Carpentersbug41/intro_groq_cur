# IELTS Opinion Essay – Main Body Paragraphs (MBP) Overview

## 1. What is an Opinion Essay?
- **Opinion essays** (also called "agree or disagree" essays) require you to state your own opinion clearly and support it throughout the essay.
- Two main question types:
  - "Do you agree or disagree?"
  - "To what extent do you agree or disagree?" (Use "strongly agree/disagree" for the latter.)
- The structure, idea generation, and planning are the same for both types, except for the strength of language in your opinion.

---

## 2. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not giving a clear opinion in the introduction (or only in the conclusion).
- Discussing other people's opinions instead of your own.
- Presenting both sides without taking a clear position.
- Not developing main ideas with explanations and examples.
- Using vague or indirect language due to cultural/educational habits.

---

## 3. Band 9 Checklist for Opinion Essays
- **Clear opinion** in the introduction.
- **Two main points** supporting your opinion.
- **Each main idea is fully developed** with explanations and examples.
- **Short conclusion** summarizing your main points and reiterating your opinion.
- **Opinion is clear throughout** (not just at the end).

---

## 4. Deciding Your Opinion
- Your actual opinion does **not** affect your score; what matters is clarity and development.
- Choose the side (agree/disagree) you can write about most easily and fully develop with two main ideas.
- Examiner does not care about your personal beliefs—choose the side you can best support.

---

## 5. Overall Structure (Four Paragraphs)
1. **Introduction**
   - Paraphrase the question.
   - State your opinion clearly (e.g., "I completely agree...").
   - Outline your two main supporting points.
2. **Main Body Paragraph 1**
   - Topic sentence: First main idea (paraphrased from intro).
   - Explanation(s): Why/how this idea supports your opinion.
   - Example: Real, general, or generalized personal example.
3. **Main Body Paragraph 2**
   - Topic sentence: Second main idea.
   - Explanation(s): Why/how this idea supports your opinion.
   - Example: Real, general, or generalized personal example.
4. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize your opinion and both main ideas.

## 6. Main Body Paragraph Formula
Each main body paragraph should contain:

1. **Topic Sentence**
   - Clearly states the main idea (directly answers the question).
   - Paraphrases the main idea from the introduction.
   - Short, clear, and relevant.
2. **Explanation(s)**
   - 2–4 sentences explaining the topic sentence.
   - Answer "why?", "how?", "what's the result?" for the main idea.
   - Logical, detailed, and clear for a reader with no background knowledge.
3. **Example**
   - Provides evidence to support the main idea.
   - Preferably a real, general example (not a personal anecdote).
   - If personal, generalize (e.g., "Many people in my country...").

**Formula:**
```
[Topic Sentence] + [Explanation(s)] + [Example]
```

---

## 7. Content Rules for Main Body Paragraphs
- **No more than two main ideas per paragraph** (usually just one).
- **Each paragraph = one main idea, fully developed.**
- **No 'firstly, secondly, thirdly, finally' lists**—avoid listing multiple ideas without development.
- **Each main idea must be explained and supported.**
- **Examples should be real and general, not personal or made-up statistics.**
- **Grammar and vocabulary must be clear and accurate** (not perfect, but must not obscure meaning).

---

## 8. Planning and Idea Generation
- Fully understand the question (topic and keywords).
- Decide your opinion (agree/disagree) based on which side you can best support.
- Generate at least two main ideas to support your opinion.
- Plan each paragraph: topic sentence, explanation(s), example.
- (Optional) List synonyms for key words to help with paraphrasing.

## 9. Example MBP Structure (for Prompt Engineering)

| Component         | Purpose/Rule                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic Sentence    | States main idea, paraphrases intro, short/clear, directly answers question  |
| Explanation(s)    | 2–4 sentences, explain/justify topic sentence, logical, detailed             |
| Example           | Real/generalized, supports main idea, not personal or made-up if possible    |

---

## 10. Language for Stating Opinion
- Use clear, direct phrases in the introduction:
  - "I completely agree/disagree..."
  - "This essay totally agrees/disagrees..."
  - "I strongly agree/disagree..." (for 'to what extent' questions)
- Pick one phrase and use it consistently.

---

## 11. Review Checklist (for Students)
- Is your opinion clear in the introduction?
- Do you have two main points supporting your opinion?
- Are both main ideas fully developed with explanations and examples?
- Is your conclusion short, summarizing your main points and opinion?
- Is your opinion clear throughout the essay?

---

## 12. Vocabulary
- Use topic-specific vocabulary (not overly complex words).
- Vary your vocabulary as much as possible, but only as much as is natural and accurate.
- Focus on clarity and appropriateness for the topic.

---

## 13. Summary
- **Opinion essays require a clear, consistent opinion, two well-developed main ideas, and a logical, formulaic structure.**
- **Each main body paragraph = [Topic Sentence] + [Explanation(s)] + [Example].**
- **Practice and review are essential for mastering the structure and achieving a high band score.**

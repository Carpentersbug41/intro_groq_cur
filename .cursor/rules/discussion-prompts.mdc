# IELTS-AI **Discussion Essay – Introduction Module**

---

## 1  Purpose  
Replicate the current **Opinion-introduction** training flow, but for **Task 2 Discussion essays** (“Discuss both views and give your opinion”).  
Anywhere the prompts now say **“Opinion”** they must be mirrored with the **Discussion** logic below.

---

## 2  Required 2-Sentence Formula  

| Sentence | Function | **Exact fixed words + slots** |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| **1** | Paraphrase both views | **Some say that** {view-1 paraphrase} **while others argue that** {view-2 paraphrase}. |
| **2** | Opinion + road-map | **This essay will argue that although** {re-paraphrased view-you-agree-with-less} {reason 1}, {re-paraphrased view-you-agree-with-more} {reason 2}. |

### Constraints  
* Exactly **two sentences**, **40 – 60 words** total.  
* In sentence 2 the clause after **although** states the view you support **less**; the next clause gives the view you support **more**.  
* Attach **one concise reason** to each clause (`reason 1`, `reason 2`).  
* No hooks, background chatter, or copied task wording.

### Copy-and-paste pattern (LLM-friendly)  

Some say that + {paraphrased view1} + while others argue that + {paraphrased view2}.
This essay will argue that although + {re - paraphrased weaker_view} + {reason1}, {re-paraphrased stronger_view} + {reason2}.

## 3  Band-9 Model Example  

**Question**  
*Some people work for the same organization all their working life, while others think that it is better to work for different organizations. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.*

**Band-9 Introduction**  
> **Some say that** it is more beneficial to be employed with the same company all their lives, **while others argue that** it is better to work for a variety of companies. **This essay will argue that although** working for just one employer gives you more financial and other benefits, working at several different places provides an employee with more experience.

*(54 words, 2 sentences)*

## 4  Module Steps to Mirror  

| Element to change (from Opinion flow) | Discussion-specific requirement |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Start-phrase validation** | Must be **“Some say that”** |
| **Paraphrased-statement span** | From after the start phrase up to **“while others argue that”** |
| **Connector inside sentence 1** | Must be **“while others argue that”** |
| **Opinion phrase validation** | Must start **“This essay will argue that although”** |
| **Auto-rewrite & feedback** | Use the Discussion formula above |

_All other mechanics (question selection, readiness checks, clause-ordering practice, band-score feedback, etc.) stay unchanged._

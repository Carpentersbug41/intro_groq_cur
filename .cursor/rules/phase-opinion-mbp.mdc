# Macro Structure: IELTS Opinion Essay – Main Body Paragraphs (MBP)

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level and low-level phases for the **Main Body Paragraphs (MBP)** module in IELTS Opinion Essays.  
It is designed for use in prompt engineering and module design, and assumes the user has already completed the introduction phase.

**Essay Flow:**  
Introduction → Main Body Paragraph 1 (MBP1) → Main Body Paragraph 2 (MBP2) → Conclusion

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Readiness

- **Prompt:** Check if the user is ready to begin practicing main body paragraphs for an opinion essay.
- **Purpose:** Ensure user engagement and readiness.

---

## Phase 2: Display Context

- **Prompt:** Display the selected essay question and the introduction (or main ideas) previously chosen/written.
- **Purpose:** Remind the user of the essay context and ensure coherence between introduction and MBPs.

---

## Phase 3: User Input Collection (Parallel for MBP1 & MBP2)

- **Prompt:** Ask the user to write both main body paragraphs (MBP1 and MBP2) for the given essay question and introduction.
- **Purpose:** Collect the user's full responses for both MBPs before analysis.

---

## Phase 4: Breakdown & Extraction (Parallel for MBP1 & MBP2)

- **Prompt:** For each MBP, break down the paragraph into:
  - Topic Sentence
  - Explanation(s)
  - Example
- **Purpose:** Prepare for detailed structural analysis.

---

## Phase 5: Component-by-Component Analysis (for each MBP, in sequence)

### 5a. Topic Sentence Analysis (see @ts.mdc)

- **Step 1:** Identify the essay type and extract the main idea from the introduction.
- **Step 2:** Output the user's topic sentence.
- **Step 3:** Check if the topic sentence matches the required formula for the essay type:
  - For opinion essays:
    - "One reason why [main idea] is that [reason 1]."
    - "Another reason why [main idea] is because [reason 2]."
- **Step 4:** Ensure the topic sentence uses the correct vocabulary from the introduction (no unnecessary synonyms).
- **Step 5:** Provide feedback:
  - ✅/❌ for formula match, clarity, and relevance.
  - If incorrect, output a corrected version using the formula and the user's introduction.

---

### 5b. Explanation Analysis (see @explantions.mdc)

- **Step 1:** Output the user's explanation(s).
- **Step 2:** Break the explanation into three key parts:
  1. **What the topic sentence means:** Clarifies or expands on the main point.
  2. **How it answers the question:** Connects the explanation to the essay question/argument.
  3. **What the result is:** Describes the outcome or consequence of the point.
- **Step 3:** Check for structure and cohesion:
  - Are all three parts present and logically ordered?
  - Are cohesive devices (e.g., "That is to say," "This is because," "As a result,") used naturally?
- **Step 4:** Provide feedback:
  - ✅/❌ for each part (clarity, logical flow, relevance).
  - If any part is missing or weak, suggest improvements or provide a model explanation with clear structure and cohesive devices.
- **Step 5:** Output a full improved explanation, if needed, and explain the use of cohesive devices.

---

### 5c. Example Analysis (see @examples.mdc)

- **Step 1:** Output the user's example.
- **Step 2:** Identify if the example is:
  - Personal/anecdotal
  - Generalized/evidence-based
  - Real-world/independent
- **Step 3:** Guide the user to improve the example:
  - If personal, explain why it may not be effective and show how to generalize it to reflect a broader trend.
  - Encourage use of real, general, or widely recognized examples.
- **Step 4:** Analyze the example for:
  - Direct support of the explanation
  - Generalization and evidence
  - Relevance and effectiveness
- **Step 5:** Provide feedback:
  - ✅/❌ for generalization, evidence, and relevance.
  - If needed, provide an improved or independent example, and explain the key elements (generalization, evidence, relevance).
- **Step 6:** (Optional) Present a side-by-side comparison of the original, improved, and independent examples, highlighting key improvements.

---

**Purpose:**  
This phase ensures that each main body paragraph is not only structurally correct at a high level, but that each component (topic sentence, explanation, example) is analyzed, improved, and modeled in a stepwise, transparent manner. This approach maximizes learning and mirrors the best practices in your existing rules.

---

## Phase 6: Overall MBP Feedback & Correction

- **Prompt:** Summarize the feedback for the entire MBP.
- **Prompt:** If any component is missing or weak, suggest a corrected version of the full paragraph using the user's ideas.
- **Purpose:** Guide the user to improve their MBPs holistically.

---

## Phase 7: Band Score Evaluation (Parallel for MBP1 & MBP2)

- **Prompt:** For each MBP, assess and output band scores for:
  - Task Response (TR)
  - Coherence & Cohesion (CC)
  - Lexical Resource (LR)
  - Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)
- **Purpose:** Give the user actionable, criterion-based feedback.

---

## Phase 8: Module Conclusion

- **Prompt:** Display a simple concluding message to signal the end of the MBP practice module.
- **Purpose:** Provide closure and next steps.

---

## Notes

- **Parallel Processing:**  
  Both MBPs are collected and analyzed in parallel for efficiency and to avoid prompt duplication.  
  (If a more interactive, step-by-step experience is desired, a series approach can be implemented in the future.)

- **Component Analysis:**  
  The analysis of topic sentence, explanation, and example is done **sequentially for each MBP**, with each step providing focused feedback and correction opportunities.

- **Integration:**  
  This MBP module is designed to fit seamlessly between the introduction and conclusion modules in the overall opinion essay workflow.

# Opinion MBP Prompt Integration Report

**Date:** [Auto-generated]
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Context:** Integration of `opinionMbpPrompts.ts` into the chat system, with full frontend and backend connection, and resolution of related issues.

---

## 1. Objective
Integrate the Opinion Main Body Paragraphs (MBP) prompt sequence (`opinionMbpPrompts.ts`) into the essay chat flow, making it selectable from the UI and fully functional in the backend.

---

## 2. Steps Taken

### 2.1. Frontend Changes
- **Added a new section** in the essay type selector UI for "Main Body Paragraphs" in `ChatWindow.tsx`.
- **Added a radio button** for "Opinion MBP" with value `opinion_mbp`.
- **Updated the `EssayType` type** to include `"opinion_mbp"`.
- **Ensured state and POST body** send the correct essayType value when selected.

### 2.2. Backend Changes
- **Imported the prompt list** from `opinionMbpPrompts.ts` in `app/api/chat/handlers/nonStreamingFlow.ts`.
- **Added a case** for `"opinion_mbp"` in the essayType switch, so the correct prompt list is used.

### 2.3. Route Handler Fix
- **Discovered a bug** in `app/api/chat/route.ts`: the allowed essayType list did not include `opinion_mbp`, so it defaulted to `opinion`.
- **Fixed the bug** by adding `opinion_mbp` to the allowed list for `resolvedEssayType`.

### 2.4. Debugging & Validation
- **Verified** that all other essay types worked, but "Opinion MBP" did not, indicating a backend filtering issue.
- **Added/checked logs** to confirm the essayType value being sent and received.
- **Tested the UI** after the fix to ensure the correct prompt flow was triggered for "Opinion MBP".

### 2.5. Server/Build Issues
- **Encountered a UI styling issue** after backend changes, traced to static asset loading and port changes.
- **Resolved by**:
  - Performing a hard refresh in the browser.
  - Cleaning the `.next` build cache and restarting the dev server.

---

## 3. Lessons Learned
- Always ensure new enum/type values are whitelisted in all backend validation logic.
- UI issues after backend changes are often due to static asset serving or build cache, not code bugs.
- Logging both frontend and backend values is critical for debugging integration issues.

---

## 4. Final State
- The "Opinion MBP" option is now fully integrated and functional.
- The prompt flow for main body paragraphs is accessible and works identically to other essay types.
- The system is robust to future prompt list additions, provided all type checks are updated.

---

## 5. Files Changed
- `components/ChatWindow.tsx`
- `app/api/chat/handlers/nonStreamingFlow.ts`
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`

---

## 6. Recommendations
- When adding new essay types or prompt flows, always update all type guards and validation logic.
- Document integration steps and issues for future maintainers.
- Regularly clean build caches when encountering unexplained UI issues.

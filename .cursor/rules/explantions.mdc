# Step 3: Guide to Improve the User's Explanations

In this section, we'll guide the user through improving their explanation using a structured approach. Each step focuses on breaking down the explanation and ensuring clarity, cohesion, and logical flow.

## 3.1: Divide the Explanation into Key Parts

### **Step 1: What the Topic Sentence Means**
- The first part of the explanation should expand on the topic sentence, explaining it with more detail.
- This part clarifies what the main point is about.

#### Example:
**User's Explanation (What the topic sentence means):**
"That is to say, online education allows students to study whenever they want and wherever they are. Since they do not need to attend physical classes, they have more free time for other activities."

---

### **Step 2: How It Answers the Question**
- This section connects the explanation directly to the essay question.
- The student must explain how their point relates to the overall argument.

#### Example:
**User's Explanation (How it answers the question):**
"This is because online courses offer students the flexibility to choose when they study, making it easier to fit education into their schedule compared to traditional classes."

---

### **Step 3: What the Result Is**
- This part describes the outcome or consequence of the point made.
- It should help conclude the paragraph or lead into the next idea.

#### Example:
**User's Explanation (What the result is):**
"As a result, students are more likely to succeed in their studies because they can manage their time without sacrificing other responsibilities."

---

## 3.2: Analyze for Structure and Cohesion

### **Step 1: Ensure Clear Structure**
- Make sure the explanation follows the structure of "What the topic sentence means," "How it answers the question," and "What the result is."
- Each section should have a distinct function in the explanation.

#### Example:
The explanation follows a clear structure:
1. **What the topic sentence means**: Provides clarification of the main point.
2. **How it answers the question**: Shows how the explanation relates to the essay question.
3. **What the result is**: Describes the outcome of the point made.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Cohesive Devices**
- Look for the use of cohesive devices that link ideas smoothly. These can include phrases such as "That is to say," "This is because," and "As a result."
- Ensure these devices help with the logical flow of ideas.

#### Example:
In the user's explanation:
- **"That is to say,"** introduces clarification of the topic sentence.
- **"This is because,"** provides a reason for the statement.
- **"As a result,"** indicates the consequence of the explanation.

---

## 3.3: Provide Feedback on Structure and Cohesive Devices

### **Step 1: Feedback on Structure**
- If the explanation lacks clear sections, suggest dividing it into the three key parts: "What the topic sentence means," "How it answers the question," and "What the result is."
- Ensure that each section has its distinct purpose and is logically organized.

#### Example Feedback:
"The explanation is clear but could benefit from a more distinct separation of ideas. Try expanding more on what the topic sentence means before jumping into how it answers the question."

---

### **Step 2: Feedback on Cohesive Devices**
- If cohesive devices are missing or incorrectly used, suggest alternatives to improve the flow.
- Encourage the user to use cohesive devices naturally without overloading the explanation with them.

#### Example Feedback:
"The use of cohesive devices like 'This is because' and 'As a result' is effective, but you might want to use 'In other words' or 'That is to say' to further clarify the main point. This would make your explanation smoother."

---

## 3.4: Provide an Improved Example Based on Feedback

### **Step 1: Present the Improved Explanation**
- After providing feedback, give the user an improved version of their explanation that demonstrates better structure and use of cohesive devices.

#### Improved Example:
**What the topic sentence means:**
"That is to say, online education allows students to study at their own pace and from any location. This flexibility gives them control over their learning environment."

**How it answers the question:**
"This is because online courses let students organize their study time around their personal and professional responsibilities, which is more difficult in traditional in-class settings."

**What the result is:**
"As a result, students can balance their studies with other commitments, making it more likely that they will complete their education successfully."

---

## 3.5: Output the Full Improved Explanation with Cohesive Devices Explained

### **Step 1: Full Improved Explanation**
- Combine all the improvements into one final explanation that is divided into its key parts and uses appropriate cohesive devices.

#### Full Improved Explanation:
"That is to say, online education allows students to study at their own pace and from any location. This flexibility gives them control over their learning environment. This is because online courses let students organize their study time around their personal and professional responsibilities, which is more difficult in traditional in-class settings. As a result, students can balance their studies with other commitments, making it more likely that they will complete their education successfully."

---

### **Step 2: Explanation of Cohesive Devices Used**
- In this explanation:
  - **"That is to say,"** introduces the clarification of the main point.
  - **"This is because,"** provides the reason behind the flexibility of online education.
  - **"As a result,"** shows the consequence of the flexibility discussed.

---

## 3.6: Provide an Independent Example (Optional)

### **Step 1: Write an Independent Example**
- Give the user a fully independent example that presents different ideas from their original explanation. This helps show another way to approach the explanation.

#### Independent Example:
**What the topic sentence means:**
"In other words, online education offers students the chance to personalize their learning experience by selecting the most convenient times and places to study."

**How it answers the question:**
"This is important because it enables students to pursue education alongside their careers, which is often not possible in traditional educational settings."

**What the result is:**
"Therefore, more individuals, including working professionals and parents, can achieve higher education without compromising their other obligations."

---

### **Step 2: Explanation of Cohesive Devices in Independent Example**
- In this independent example:
  - **"In other words,"** introduces a restatement of the topic sentence.
  - **"This is important because,"** connects the point to its relevance to the essay question.
  - **"Therefore,"** signals the conclusion or outcome of the explanation.

---

## 3.7: Compare the Original, Improved, and Independent Versions Side-by-Side

### **Step 1: Present a Comparison**
- Present the original, improved, and independent explanations side-by-side to help the user understand the differences and improvements made.


---

### **Step 2: Highlight Key Improvements**

- **Original**: While the structure is generally clear, there are some cohesion issues, and the explanation could be expanded with more details.
- **Improved**: The explanation has been expanded and improved with better cohesive devices and more logical flow. It also provides more detail on how flexibility helps students succeed.
- **Independent**: This version takes a different approach, presenting the flexibility in terms of personalization of the learning experience, focusing on how it accommodates working professionals and parents.

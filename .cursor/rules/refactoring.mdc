Please follow these rules for refactoring:

1. **Split** the single large file into multiple smaller files:

   - The main `route.ts` should only parse the request, decide if streaming or not, and call the relevant handler.

1.5 Do the easiest most simple changes first
1.7 Do the changes step by step - don't try to refactor everything at once

2. Do **not** change the existing logic or remove console logs; just refactor it into separate modules and re-import.  
3. Ensure each new module has **only** the relevant functions.  
4. Import statements in `route.ts` must be updated so everything compiles.  
5. Keep the code DRY. If there’s repeated logic in `route.ts` that belongs to a helper, please move it out.  
6. Use minimal changes to the existing function signatures – only what’s required to cleanly separate them.  
7. Maintain the same exports for the `POST` function so it’s still recognized as the Next.js route.  
8. Provide me with **all** new files & the updated imports in your final answer.
9. NEVER do it all in one go - do it step by step stopping after each step to check.

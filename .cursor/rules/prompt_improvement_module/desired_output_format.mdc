# Desired Output Formation & Format

## Purpose
This document defines how to create, format, and review desired outputs for each prompt in the prompt improvement module. These outputs serve as the gold standard for grading and improvement.

---

## File Naming & Location
- **All desired outputs are now stored in a single file:** `desired_outputs/all_desired_outputs.md`.
- Each prompt's output is clearly separated and labeled by prompt number (e.g., `## Prompt 0`, `## Prompt 1`, etc.).

---

## Content & Extraction
- The content for each prompt should be the **exact, literal ideal output** for that prompt.
- Extract the output from the "Example Output" section of the prompt definition (e.g., from `@prompts.ts`).
- Preserve all formatting (Markdown, line breaks, bolding, etc.) as shown in the example.
- If no example output is present, consult a subject matter expert to define the ideal output.

---

## Formatting Rules
- Use plain text or Markdown as appropriate for the prompt.
- Do not add any extra commentary, explanations, or metadataâ€”only the desired output itself.
- Each prompt's output should be preceded by a heading (e.g., `## Prompt 0`) and separated by `---`.
- If the output is multi-line, preserve all line breaks and formatting.
- If the output includes Markdown headings, bold, or code blocks, retain them exactly.

---

## Review Process
1. **Automated Extraction (Optional):**
   - Use a script to extract example outputs from the prompt definitions file.
2. **Human Review:**
   - Manually review each section in `all_desired_outputs.md` to ensure:
     - The output matches expectations and requirements.
     - Formatting is correct and complete.
     - The output is truly the "gold standard" for that prompt.
3. **Edit as Needed:**
   - Make corrections or improvements directly in the file.

## Example

```
## Prompt 0

---

## Prompt 1
**The next stage is focused on practicing writing main body paragraphs (MBPs) for IELTS opinion essay main body paragraphs.**

You will be shown an introduction and question.

Your task is to write two main body paragraphs that support the opinion given.
```

## Notes
- All desired outputs must be reviewed and approved before use in grading.
- If a prompt's ideal output changes, update the corresponding section and log the change.

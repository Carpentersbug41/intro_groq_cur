# Macro Structure of IELTS Introduction/Conclusion Prompt Sequences

This document outlines the common high-level functional blocks found across the prompt files for practicing IELTS essay introductions and conclusions (e.g., `opinionPrompts.ts`, `adsType1Prompts.ts`, `discussionPrompts.ts`, `conclusionPrompts.ts`). While the specific content, formulas, and variables differ based on the essay type (Opinion, Adv/Disadv, Discussion) and part (Introduction, Conclusion), the overall workflow follows a consistent pattern.

**Phase 1: Setup & Readiness**

*   **Prompts:** Typically Prompt 0.
*   **Purpose:** Checks if the user is ready to begin the specific module (e.g., "Are you ready to practice Opinion Introductions?").

**Phase 2: Question/Example Selection & Confirmation**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 1-3.
*   **Purpose:** Selects (often randomly) the specific essay question or example text (like an introduction for the conclusion module) that will serve as the basis for the user's task. It then confirms with the user if they want to proceed with the selected item or choose another one. Finally, displays the confirmed question/example.
*   **Variation:** `conclusionPrompts.ts` differs slightly, explaining the task (using an intro to write a conclusion) before selecting and confirming the example introduction.

**Phase 3: User Input Collection**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 4-5.
*   **Purpose:** Asks the user to write their essay part (introduction or conclusion) based on the selected question/example. It then displays the user's submitted text back to them and saves it into a memory variable (e.g., `[user_introduction]`, `user conclusion`).

**Phase 4: Context Gathering & Preliminary Extraction**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 6-9 (can extend to ~11 in `conclusionPrompts.ts`).
*   **Purpose:** Re-displays the original question/example context and extracts key components from both the *original source* and the *user's submission*. This prepares the necessary pieces for later analysis.
*   **Examples of Extracted Components (Varies by File):**
    *   Original full question text
    *   Original question statement (without instruction)
    *   Original opinion (from example intro)
    *   User's background statement / paraphrased views / conclusion opinion statement
    *   User's stated ideas/reasons

**Phase 5: Formula Structure Analysis**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 10/11/12 to 19/20.
*   **Purpose:** Focuses on teaching and evaluating the specific structural formula required for *that* module's essay part.
    1.  (Optional Readiness Check)
    2.  Explain the specific formula (e.g., Adv/Disadv Intro formula, Opinion Conclusion formula).
    3.  Display the user's submission again.
    4.  Break down the user's submission into components based *only* on the formula's structure.
    5.  (Optional Readiness Check)
    6.  Evaluate each component of the user's breakdown against the formula's requirements (presence, specific phrasing like "and", "because", "while others argue that").
    7.  Provide a corrected version of the user's submission that strictly adheres to the formula, using their original ideas where possible, if errors were found.

**Phase 6: Paraphrasing Analysis**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 20/21 to 26/27.
*   **Purpose:** Focuses on evaluating the user's ability to paraphrase key elements from the original question/source material.
    1.  (Optional Readiness Check)
    2.  Explain the specific paraphrasing check being performed (e.g., original statement vs. user's background).
    3.  Display the relevant original text and the user's corresponding paraphrased text side-by-side.
    4.  Extract key vocabulary (nouns, verbs, adjectives) from the original text.
    5.  Identify which keywords the user changed (synonyms used) in their paraphrase.
    6.  Evaluate the *quality* and *extent* of the user's paraphrasing (accuracy, naturalness, sufficiency of changes). Provide feedback and suggest better synonyms if needed (without repeating original words).
    7.  Provide a high-quality model paraphrase of the original text.

**Phase 7: Idea/Reason Quality Analysis**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 27/28 to 30/35.
*   **Purpose:** Evaluates the quality of the specific supporting ideas or reasons the user included in their introduction/conclusion.
    1.  (Optional Readiness Check)
    2.  Explain the quality criteria (e.g., relevance to the argument, clarity, conciseness for intro/conclusion).
    3.  Display the user's submission and/or the previously extracted ideas/reasons.
    4.  Evaluate each idea/reason against the criteria and provide feedback with suggestions for improvement if necessary.

**Phase 8: Band Score Evaluation**

*   **Prompts:** ~ Prompts 31/32 to 35/40.
*   **Purpose:** Provides an estimated IELTS band score for the user's introduction/conclusion based on the four criteria: Task Response (TR), Coherence and Cohesion (CC), Lexical Resource (LR), and Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA). Each criterion is typically evaluated in a separate prompt.
    1.  (Optional Readiness Check)
    2.  Evaluate TR (focusing on addressing the prompt and formula adherence).
    3.  Evaluate CC (focusing on flow, linking, and clarity).
    4.  Evaluate LR (focusing on vocabulary range, precision, naturalness within formula constraints).
    5.  Evaluate GRA (focusing on sentence structure accuracy, formula implementation, general grammar/punctuation).

**Phase 9: Module Conclusion**

*   **Prompts:** Final Prompt (e.g., Index 36/39/41).
*   **Purpose:** Displays a simple concluding message to signal the end of the practice module.

animations documentaries commercials and
even feature films

Interviewer:
do you like living in
New
York

Nick:
I love living in New York City a
lot of people think it's too crowded or
it's too busy or it's too stressful but
for me I think it's just the energy of
the place is something I really love
first it's great because my friends my
family are all here because I grew up
here but also there's so much happening
culturally there's always music going on
always films happening all of my friends
live here because I went to high school
and Junior High School here in New York
City what I love most about New York
City is all of the different cultures
communities and ethnicities that are
here people who live in New York known
as New Yorkers have a reputation for
being impatient and rather the bad
tempered but this is just a
stereotype most like Nick are hard
working and
ambitious

Interviewer:
what do you like about your
New York neighbors

Nick:
people here are
always really passionate about what
they're doing whether it's their
business or their art or um their job
and I love the energy that the city has
New York is an enormous and exciting
city with a population of over over 8
million
people many parts of New York are modern
crowded and
noisy but there are also older quieter
areas that are home to lots of
artists and creative young people like
Nick

Interviewer:
which part of the city do you live
in

Nick:
I live in SoHo in lower Manhattan in
New York City and I love my neighborhood
because it's so full of History
a lot of the buildings are over 100
years old and they were factories and
the building that I live in is an old
factory that was turned into Apartments
Nick's apartment is great it's on the
second floor and it's pretty big and
quiet it's the perfect place for him to
relax Nick enjoys practicing yoga in his
free
time and the apartment is very
convenient too it's only a 10-minute
cycle ride from his

[Music]

Interviewer:
office New York is a city famous for its
Cosmopolitan
population it's a city of optimistic
immigrants
people who came from around the world in
search of new
lives and Nick's family is no
exception so where does your family come
from

Nick:
so I have a really interesting
family background my mother's side of
the
family is from India from Kolkata
which is in the East part of India and
my father's side of the family is from
Europe from what uh is now
bellarus Nick's father's family came to
New York to escape the second world war
like many other European
immigrants but his mother's family story
is very unusual so my grandfather came
from India in the 1930s which was very
unusual there weren't a lot of Indian
people here in New York City at that
time now there are a lot and he was a
blind Professor Nick's grandmother was
was a New
Yorker she lived in an area of the city
called the
Bronx

Interviewer:
so how did she meet a blind
Professor from India in this city of
millions of people

Nick:
my grandmother was
from the Bronx and the story is that
because he was blind he was having
trouble crossing the street and she
helped him out and they cross the street
together fell in love and then they went
from New York City to India and got
married in the
1940s Nick's grandparents returned to
New York from India and both of his
parents were born in the city my mother
and my father met here in New York city
so I'm part Indian and part Eastern
European

Interviewer:
who do you look
like

Nick:
everybody says that I look just
like my mom and that my brother looks
just like my dad I have the same skin
color hair color eye color as my mom and
my brother has the same skin color hair
color and eye color as my dad so some
people think we look alike I think we
couldn't look more different

Interviewer:
are you
still close to your family today

Nick:
I'm really close with my brother I like to
stay in touch with him even though he
lives in Germany so we Skype or FaceTime
or video chat almost every day whenever
we have time I'm also lucky that my mom
lives right here in New York city so I'm
able to visit her sometimes after work
we'll have dinner and hang out my family
loves to travel every year we'll take a
trip if we have time sometimes we'll go
to the Caribbean and go scuba diving
which is awesome sometimes we'll go to
Europe my brother lives in Germany and
he's an opera conductor so we'll go
there visit him and see his operas and
then when we have time we go to India
which is where my mother's family is uh
they're amazing cooks and we'll eat
great Indian food and hang out in
Kolkata which is where her family is
from

[Music]

Interviewer:
today Nick is a full-time
filmmaker he owns and runs his own
Successful video production
company did your parents influence your
choice of
career

Nick:
so my dad was always a business
and numbers guy but my mother is an
artist she was an
opera singer when she
was younger and she loves movies she
loves music and I think a lot of the
artistic spirit that I have comes from
her so I think in some ways what I'm
doing is really a perfect mix between my
dad and my mom they were both a big
influence on me and I hope they're proud

Interviewer:
running your own video production
company sounds like a challenging and
exhausting
business what's your job like

Nick:
I love
making movies
I've made movies since I was a little
kid and I'm always looking around and
thinking about things that I see and the
stories that are out there and I'm
always thinking about how to tell great
stories using film so I will go to
location interview people work with
actors bring a film crew together that
can be camera people sound people
editors animators and I bring the whole
team together to try to make the best
film possible
as you can imagine I'm really busy I'm
always doing 10 projects at the same
time I'm often traveling so sometimes
for a video that's only a minute long we
might shoot 10 hours of footage I just
came back from India Norway and Seattle
doing a global commercial where we
filmed for almost 10 days and the whole
thing will be edited into 1 minute
although it can be exhausting Nick's job
is never boring he's got a great team
around him and he is always excited
about the next project and the
opportunity to tell a brand new
story and the
opportunity to tell a brand new story
and the remarkable history of his
immigrant family is never very far from
Nick's mind when he is
working a lot of the films that I've
made are about the stories of immigrants
they're about people who have come from
one country or one culture and moved
into another in the hopes of trying to
have a better life and what I'm really
interested in is how can movies change
the way people think the way they feel
the way they act how can films make
people more caring about each other make
them see points of view that they
weren't familiar with before and
hopefully make the world a little bit
better so our company is called people's
TV because we make movies about people
that you don't always see uh on
TV'

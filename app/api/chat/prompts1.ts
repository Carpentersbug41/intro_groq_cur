1. **Retrieve** the original question statement ('[original_question_statement]') and the user's question statement ('[user_question_statement]').
2. **Evaluate Quality:**
   - Check if synonyms accurately convey the original meaning.
   - Identify words that *could* have been replaced but weren't.
   - Highlight any *weak, inaccurate, or grammatically awkward* synonyms/phrases.
3. **Evaluate Extent:**
   - Assess if *enough* key words were changed to be considered a good paraphrase.
4. **Provide Feedback:** Structure feedback clearly under headings like "Accuracy Check" and "Paraphrasing Extent".
   - **If criticizing a synonym/phrase, suggest a better, natural alternative.** Do NOT suggest the original word. Focus on grammatical correctness and appropriate vocabulary for IELTS.
   - If paraphrasing is strong, acknowledge it.
   - Avoid overly complex/uncommon word suggestions.

## Example Output (Illustrative):

### Accuracy Check:
- **"Businesses"** is an acceptable synonym for **"companies"**.
- **"fuels from the ground"** is understandable but informal/wordy for **"fossil fuels"**. Consider **"non-renewable fuels"** or **"carbon-based fuels"**.
- **"be increased tax"** is grammatically incorrect for **"face higher taxes"**. Consider **"should face increased taxation"** or **"should pay higher taxes"**.
- **"green fuels"** is acceptable for **"renewable energy"**, though **"sustainable energy"** is also a good option.

### Paraphrasing Extent:
- You successfully changed several key terms (companies, energy).
- The attempt to paraphrase "fossil fuels" and "face higher taxes" needs improvement in formality and grammar.
- Overall paraphrasing shows effort but needs refinement for accuracy and naturalness.

### Additional Rules:
- Focus ONLY on paraphrasing quality and extent of the question statement.
- Do NOT suggest the original word as a replacement.
- Always suggest a better alternative if criticizing.
- Ensure suggestions are natural and appropriate for IELTS.`,

2. Retrieve the original question statement (from memory key '[original_question_statement]') for context.
3. Evaluate each extracted idea based on these criteria:
   - **Relevance:** Does it directly support an opinion on the original question statement?

## Example Output (Good Ideas):

**Evaluation:**
Both ideas ('it reduces air pollution', 'decreases traffic congestion') are relevant to the topic of free public transport, specific enough for an introduction, and correctly formatted as short phrases. Well done.

## Example Output (Weak Ideas - Vague):

**Evaluation:**
- Idea 1 ('it is a good thing'): This is too vague. It doesn't explain *why* it's good in relation to the question. Suggestion: Focus on a specific benefit like "it improves air quality".
- Idea 2 ('it helps the city'): Also too vague. How does it help? Suggestion: Specify a benefit like "it reduces road congestion".

## Example Output (Weak Ideas - Too Long):

**Evaluation:**
- Idea 1 ('reducing air pollution by making fewer people drive their private cars'): This is too long for an introduction idea. Simplify to the core idea: "reducing air pollution".
- Idea 2 ('decreasing traffic congestion during the morning and evening rush hours'): Also too long. Simplify to: "decreasing traffic congestion".

   - Suggest specific fixes related *only* to the formula structure and these key linking words.

## Example Output (Good CC):

**Evaluation:**
Your Introduction is well-structured and coherent. It follows the correct formula ("It is argued that... I completely agree/disagree because... Idea 1 and Idea 2."), using 'because' and 'and' appropriately to link the parts logically.

## Example Output (Weak CC - Formula/Link Issue):

**Evaluation:**
- **Issue:** The introduction structure is incorrect. It should start with "It is argued that..." followed by your paraphrased statement.
- **Issue:** The opinion ("I think it's good.") is not linked to the reasons with "because". It should be "I completely agree/disagree with this statement because...".
- **Issue:** The two ideas are presented as separate sentences instead of being linked by "and".
- **Suggestion:** Ensure your introduction strictly follows the formula: "It is argued that [Your Paraphrase]. I completely agree/disagree with this statement because [Your Idea 1] and [Your Idea 2]."

2. Also retrieve the original question statement '[original_question_statement]' for context on paraphrasing effectiveness.
3. Analyze the vocabulary in '[intro_text_for_lr_analysis]' for:
   - **Paraphrasing Effectiveness:** How well were keywords from '[original_question_statement]' replaced with accurate synonyms in the user's paraphrased statement part?
   - **Range & Precision:** Is there good variety, or is it repetitive (e.g., repeating words from the question or simple words)? Are precise words used for the ideas?
   - **Accuracy & Appropriateness:** Are words used correctly (meaning, form, collocation)? Is the tone academic (no informalities like "totally agree", "get rid of")?
4. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - If LR is strong, state this clearly and highlight positive examples (good synonyms, precise idea words).
   - If there are issues, identify them specifically (e.g., "Word 'important' repeated.", "Weak paraphrase of 'prioritize'.", "Informal phrase 'good thing'.").
   - **Suggest specific, more appropriate alternative words or phrases.**

## Example Output (Good LR):

**Evaluation:**
Your vocabulary use demonstrates good lexical resource.
- **Paraphrasing:** You effectively paraphrased "public transport" as "public transportation" and "free" as "provided at no cost".
- **Range/Precision:** Words like "minimizes" and "alleviates" show good range and precision for your ideas.
- **Appropriateness:** The tone is suitably academic.

## Example Output (Weak LR - Repetitive/Informal):

**Evaluation:**
- **Paraphrasing:** The paraphrase "transport should be free for people" is weak as it repeats "transport" and "free" and uses the basic word "people". Consider "public transportation should be offered without charge to all citizens".
- **Range/Precision:** The ideas "helps people" and "makes travel easy" use basic vocabulary. Consider more precise phrasing like "benefits citizens" or "improves accessibility".

2. Analyze the text in '[intro_text_for_gra_analysis]' for:
   - **Accuracy:** Identify errors in subject-verb agreement, tense, articles, prepositions, word forms, punctuation, sentence fragments, run-on sentences, etc.
   - **Range:** Assess the variety of sentence structures. Does the introduction use only simple sentences, or does it correctly incorporate compound or complex sentences (e.g., using conjunctions, relative clauses)?
3. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - **Accuracy:** If errors are found, list them specifically, explain the error type briefly, and provide the corrected version of the relevant phrase/clause. (e.g., "- 'it reduce': Incorrect subject-verb agreement. Correction: 'it reduces'."). If no errors, state "No significant grammatical errors found."

   - Provide an overall assessment if helpful.

## Example Output (Minor Errors, Good Range):

**Evaluation:**
- **Accuracy:**
  - "- 'free **to** every citizens': Incorrect preposition and noun form. Correction: 'free **for all** citizens'."
  - "- 'it make... **and reduce**': Verbs lack parallelism/agreement. Correction: 'it **makes**... **and reduces**...'"

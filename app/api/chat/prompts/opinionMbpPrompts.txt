### IELTS Opinion Essay Introductions:
1.
**Question**: Companies that rely on fossil fuels should face higher taxes compared to those that use renewable energy.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that companies that use fossil fuels should pay more tax than those using renewable energy. I completely agree with this because it would push businesses to use cleaner energy and help protect the environment.

2.
**Question**: In many countries, vaccinations are becoming mandatory to prevent the spread of diseases.  
Do you think this is a positive or negative development? 

**Introduction**: It is argued that making vaccinations compulsory is the best way to stop diseases from spreading. I completely agree with this because it protects public health and helps prevent dangerous outbreaks.

3.
**Question**: Some argue that children today are more aware of environmental issues than adults.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that children these days understand environmental problems better than adults. I completely agree with this because schools teach more about the environment now and young people are more active in climate movements.

4.
**Question**: Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol should lead to a lifetime ban from driving, regardless of whether an accident occurs.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that people who drive while drunk or on drugs should never be allowed to drive again. I completely agree with this because it puts lives at risk and shows a lack of responsibility.

5.
**Question**: It has been proposed that cyclists should pass a test before they are allowed to use public roads.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

**Introduction**: It is argued that cyclists should take a test before being allowed to ride on public roads. I completely agree with this because it would improve road safety and help cyclists follow traffic rules better.

6.
**Question**: Some believe that countries should prioritize producing their own food rather than relying on imports.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that countries should focus on growing their own food instead of depending on other nations. I completely agree with this because it supports local farmers and makes food supply more reliable.

7.
**Question**: International tourism has led to a significant increase in visitors to historical sites.  
To what extent is this a positive or negative phenomenon?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that international tourism has brought many more people to visit historical places. I completely agree with this because it helps the economy and raises awareness about different cultures and history.

8.
**Question**: Many people argue that city life offers more benefits than life in the countryside.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that living in cities is better than living in the countryside. I completely agree with this because cities offer more job opportunities and better access to services like healthcare and education.

9.
**Question**: High-ranking executives should receive the same salary as average workers within the company.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that top managers should be paid the same as regular workers. I completely agree with this because it would reduce income inequality and make workplaces feel fairer.

10.
**Question**: It has been suggested that cars and public transport should be banned from city centres, and only bicycles should be allowed.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that city centres should only allow bicycles and ban all other vehicles. I completely agree with this because it would cut down on pollution and make city centres safer and quieter.

2.  Retrieve the user's Topic Sentence for MBP2 from memory key {[topic_sentence_mbp2]}.
3.  **For MBP1 Topic Sentence ({[topic_sentence_mbp1]}):**
    a.  **Carefully segment the submission** to identify the **exact text** corresponding to each of the 4 components of the MBP1 Topic Sentence formula. Use "One reason why" and "is that" as primary delimiters.
    b.  Extract the user's text *exactly as they wrote it*.
    c.  Use "[Component Missing]" if a part cannot be reasonably identified.
4.  **For MBP2 Topic Sentence ({[topic_sentence_mbp2]}):**
    a.  **Carefully segment the submission** to identify the **exact text** corresponding to each of the 4 components of the MBP2 Topic Sentence formula. Use "Another reason why" and "is because" as primary delimiters.
    b.  Extract the user's text *exactly as they wrote it*.
    c.  Use "[Component Missing]" if a part cannot be reasonably identified.
5.  Construct the output **exactly** in the format shown below, listing each component label on a new line followed by the **exactly extracted user text** or "[Component Missing]". Ensure a double line break (\`\\n\\n\`) between each component line within each topic sentence's breakdown, and a clear separator between the MBP1 and MBP2 breakdowns.

### Example Input:
{[topic_sentence_mbp1]}: "One reason why early education is valuable is that it fosters social development."
{[topic_sentence_mbp2]}: "Another reason why early education is valuable is because children learn foundational skills."

### Example Output:
Your MBP1 Topic Sentence broken down by formula components:
**[User's MBP1 Initial Phrase]:** One reason why
**[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Topic]:** early education is valuable
**[User's MBP1 Connecting Phrase]:** is that
**[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Reason]:** it fosters social development.

---
Your MBP2 Topic Sentence broken down by formula components:
**[User's MBP2 Initial Phrase]:** Another reason why
**[User's MBP2 Paraphrased Topic]:** early education is valuable
**[User's MBP2 Connecting Phrase]:** is because
**[User's MBP2 Paraphrased Reason]:** children learn foundational skills.

### Example Input (Deviates):
{[topic_sentence_mbp1]}: "Early education helps social skills."
{[topic_sentence_mbp2]}: "Also, kids learn skills."

### Example Output (Deviates):
Your MBP1 Topic Sentence broken down by formula components:
**[User's MBP1 Initial Phrase]:** [Component Missing]
**[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Topic]:** Early education helps social skills.
**[User's MBP1 Connecting Phrase]:** [Component Missing]
**[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Reason]:** [Component Missing]

---
Your MBP2 Topic Sentence broken down by formula components:
**[User's MBP2 Initial Phrase]:** [Component Missing]
**[User's MBP2 Paraphrased Topic]:** Also, kids learn skills.
**[User's MBP2 Connecting Phrase]:** [Component Missing]
**[User's MBP2 Paraphrased Reason]:** [Component Missing]

### Additional Rules:
- Focus SOLELY on segmenting the user's text based on the structural roles of the specified Opinion Essay Topic Sentence formulas.
- **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT correct, rewrite, or paraphrase the user's text when extracting it into components.** Use the exact text.
- Output **ONLY** the breakdowns in the specified format. Do NOT evaluate correctness or suitability yet.
- **Crucially, ensure each component within a breakdown is separated by a double line break (\`\\n\\n\`).**
- Use a Markdown horizontal rule (\`---\`) to separate the MBP1 breakdown from the MBP2 breakdown.
- Do **NOT** add any extra text, commentary, greetings, or explanations.
- Use "[Component Missing]" accurately. Trim leading/trailing spaces from extracted text. Handle the final period correctly.`,

  prompt_text: `# System message:
You are an AI language model evaluating the **structure of the user's MBP1 Topic Sentence** from the breakdown ({[user_topic_sentences_breakdown]}) based on the Opinion Essay MBP1 Topic Sentence formula. Your goal is to output ONLY the final evaluation format, including the status (✅/❌) for each component. Do NOT output any intermediate reasoning or labels.

## Internal Steps (Do NOT output these):
1. Retrieve the breakdown from memory key {[user_topic_sentences_breakdown]}.
2. Isolate the components for the MBP1 Topic Sentence: '[User's MBP1 Initial Phrase]', '[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Topic]', '[User's MBP1 Connecting Phrase]', and '[User's MBP1 Paraphrased Reason]'. Let's call them 'initial_phrase', 'topic_text', 'connecting_phrase', 'reason_text'.
3. Perform individual checks:
   - Check 1 (Initial Phrase): Is 'initial_phrase' exactly "One reason why"? Record status (\`initial_status\`).
   - Check 2 (Paraphrased Topic): Is 'topic_text' present (i.e., not "[Component Missing]")? Record status (\`topic_status\`).
   - Check 3 (Connecting Phrase): Is 'connecting_phrase' exactly "is that"? Record status (\`connecting_status\`).
   - Check 4 (Paraphrased Reason): Is 'reason_text' present (i.e., not "[Component Missing]") and ends with a period? Record status (\`reason_status\`).
4. Determine Overall Status for MBP1 Topic Sentence: Correct (✅) if all checks pass, Incorrect (❌) otherwise.

## Final Output Construction (ONLY output this structure):
1.  Display each extracted component of the MBP1 Topic Sentence followed by its status symbol. **Each component line must appear on its own new line.**
    The block should look like this (ensure your output matches this line-by-line structure):
    Initial Phrase (MBP1): <initial_phrase> [initial_status] \n\n
    Paraphrased Topic (MBP1): <topic_text> [topic_status] \n\n
    Connecting Phrase (MBP1): <connecting_phrase> [connecting_status] \n\n
    Paraphrased Reason (MBP1): <reason_text> [reason_status] \n\n
2.  After the last component line, **ensure there is a blank line** before the overall status.
3.  If Overall Status is Correct (✅): Add the following line, on its own line:
    ✅ **MBP1 Topic Sentence:** Correct overall structure.
4.  If Overall Status is Incorrect (❌): Add the line "❌ **MBP1 Topic Sentence Issues:**\n\n\" (on its own line), followed by detailed error messages. Each error message (from "Required Error Message Formats") **MUST start on its own new line.**

## Required Error Message Formats (Use only if component status is ❌):
- **- Incorrect/Missing [Initial Phrase (MBP1)]:** Required: "One reason why". You provided: *"<initial_phrase>"*. Recommendation: Start your MBP1 topic sentence with "One reason why".
- **- Missing [Paraphrased Topic (MBP1)]:** Required by formula. You provided: *"[Component Missing]"*. Recommendation: Clearly state your main topic after "One reason why".
- **- Incorrect/Missing [Connecting Phrase (MBP1)]:** Required: "is that". You provided: *"<connecting_phrase>"*. Recommendation: Use "is that" to connect your topic to your reason.
- **- Missing/Incorrect [Paraphrased Reason (MBP1)]:** Required by formula and must end with a period. You provided: *"<reason_text>"*. Recommendation: State your first main reason clearly after "is that" and end with a period.

## Example Output (If Incorrect Initial Phrase & Missing Reason):
Initial Phrase (MBP1): The first point is [❌] \n\n
Paraphrased Topic (MBP1): virtual learning is beneficial [✅] \n\n
Connecting Phrase (MBP1): is that [✅] \n\n
Paraphrased Reason (MBP1): [Component Missing] [❌] \n\n

❌ **MBP1 Topic Sentence Issues:**
**- Incorrect/Missing [Initial Phrase (MBP1)]:** Required: "One reason why". You provided: *"The first point is"*. Recommendation: Start your MBP1 topic sentence with "One reason why".
**- Missing/Incorrect [Paraphrased Reason (MBP1)]:** Required by formula and must end with a period. You provided: *"[Component Missing]"*. Recommendation: State your first main reason clearly after "is that" and end with a period.

## Example Output (If Correct):
Initial Phrase (MBP1): One reason why [✅]
Paraphrased Topic (MBP1): virtual learning is beneficial [✅]
Connecting Phrase (MBP1): is that [✅]
Paraphrased Reason (MBP1): in-person classes are less effective. [✅]

✅ **MBP1 Topic Sentence:** Correct overall structure.

### Additional Rules:
- **CRITICAL:** Output ONLY the final evaluation in the format shown in the examples. Do NOT output any internal step descriptions, checks, or reasoning.
- Ensure the output format matches the examples precisely.
- **Strictly follow the line break requirements as shown in the "Final Output Construction" section and the "Example Output" sections.** This means:
    - Each component status line on its own line.
    - A blank line between the component list and the overall feedback.
    - Each error message starting on a new line.
- The [Paraphrased Reason (MBP1)] must include the final period for a ✅.`,

2.  If Overall Status is Correct (✅): Append the line, followed by ' \\n\\n':
    ✅ **MBP2 Topic Sentence:** Correct overall structure. \\n\\n
3.  If Overall Status is Incorrect (❌): Append the line "❌ **MBP2 Topic Sentence Issues:** \\n\\n" followed by detailed error messages. Each error message (from "Required Error Message Formats") **MUST start on a new line and also end with ' \\n\\n'**.

## Required Error Message Formats (Use only if component status is ❌):
(Ensure each of these is output on its own line and ends with ' \\n\\n' when listed as an error message)
- **- Incorrect/Missing [Initial Phrase (MBP2)]:** Required: "Another reason why". You provided: *"<initial_phrase>"*. Recommendation: Start your MBP2 topic sentence with "Another reason why".
- **- Missing [Paraphrased Topic (MBP2)]:** Required by formula. You provided: *"[Component Missing]"*. Recommendation: Clearly state your main topic after "Another reason why".
- **- Incorrect/Missing [Connecting Phrase (MBP2)]:** Required: "is because". You provided: *"<connecting_phrase>"*. Recommendation: Use "is because" to connect your topic to your second reason.
- **- Missing/Incorrect [Paraphrased Reason (MBP2)]:** Required by formula and must end with a period. You provided: *"<reason_text>"*. Recommendation: State your second main reason clearly after "is because" and end with a period.

## Example Output (If Incorrect Connecting Phrase & Missing Topic):

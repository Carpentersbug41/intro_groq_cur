**Question**: Companies that rely on fossil fuels should face higher taxes compared to those that use renewable energy.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that companies that use fossil fuels should pay more tax than those using renewable energy. I completely agree with this because it would push businesses to use cleaner energy and help protect the environment.

2.
**Question**: In many countries, vaccinations are becoming mandatory to prevent the spread of diseases.  
Do you think this is a positive or negative development? 

**Introduction**: It is argued that making vaccinations compulsory is the best way to stop diseases from spreading. I completely agree with this because it protects public health and helps prevent dangerous outbreaks.

3.
**Question**: Some argue that children today are more aware of environmental issues than adults.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that children these days understand environmental problems better than adults. I completely agree with this because schools teach more about the environment now and young people are more active in climate movements.

4.
**Question**: Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol should lead to a lifetime ban from driving, regardless of whether an accident occurs.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that people who drive while drunk or on drugs should never be allowed to drive again. I completely agree with this because it puts lives at risk and shows a lack of responsibility.

5.
**Question**: It has been proposed that cyclists should pass a test before they are allowed to use public roads.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

**Introduction**: It is argued that cyclists should take a test before being allowed to ride on public roads. I completely agree with this because it would improve road safety and help cyclists follow traffic rules better.

6.
**Question**: Some believe that countries should prioritize producing their own food rather than relying on imports.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that countries should focus on growing their own food instead of depending on other nations. I completely agree with this because it supports local farmers and makes food supply more reliable.

7.
**Question**: International tourism has led to a significant increase in visitors to historical sites.  
To what extent is this a positive or negative phenomenon?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that international tourism has brought many more people to visit historical places. I completely agree with this because it helps the economy and raises awareness about different cultures and history.

8.
**Question**: Many people argue that city life offers more benefits than life in the countryside.  
Do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that living in cities is better than living in the countryside. I completely agree with this because cities offer more job opportunities and better access to services like healthcare and education.

9.
**Question**: High-ranking executives should receive the same salary as average workers within the company.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that top managers should be paid the same as regular workers. I completely agree with this because it would reduce income inequality and make workplaces feel fairer.

10.
**Question**: It has been suggested that cars and public transport should be banned from city centres, and only bicycles should be allowed.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

**Introduction**: It is argued that city centres should only allow bicycles and ban all other vehicles. I completely agree with this because it would cut down on pollution and make city centres safer and quieter.

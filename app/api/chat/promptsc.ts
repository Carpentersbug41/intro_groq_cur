  ### IELTS Opinion Essay Introductions:
  1.
  Question: Companies that rely on fossil fuels should face higher taxes compared to those that use renewable energy.  
  To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that companies that use fossil fuels should pay more tax than those using renewable energy. I completely agree with this because it would push businesses to use cleaner energy and help protect the environment.
  
  2.
  Question: In many countries, vaccinations are becoming mandatory to prevent the spread of diseases.  
  Do you think this is a positive or negative development? 

  Introduction: It is argued that making vaccinations compulsory is the best way to stop diseases from spreading. I completely agree with this because it protects public health and helps prevent dangerous outbreaks.
  
  3.
  Question: Some argue that children today are more aware of environmental issues than adults.  
  To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that children these days understand environmental problems better than adults. I completely agree with this because schools teach more about the environment now and young people are more active in climate movements.
  
  4.
  Question: Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol should lead to a lifetime ban from driving, regardless of whether an accident occurs.  
  Do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that people who drive while drunk or on drugs should never be allowed to drive again. I completely agree with this because it puts lives at risk and shows a lack of responsibility.
  
  5.
  Question: It has been proposed that cyclists should pass a test before they are allowed to use public roads.  
  To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

  Introduction: It is argued that cyclists should take a test before being allowed to ride on public roads. I completely agree with this because it would improve road safety and help cyclists follow traffic rules better.
  
  6.
  Question: Some believe that countries should prioritize producing their own food rather than relying on imports.  
  Do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that countries should focus on growing their own food instead of depending on other nations. I completely agree with this because it supports local farmers and makes food supply more reliable.
  
  7.
  Question: International tourism has led to a significant increase in visitors to historical sites.  
  To what extent is this a positive or negative phenomenon?  

  Introduction: It is argued that international tourism has brought many more people to visit historical places. I completely agree with this because it helps the economy and raises awareness about different cultures and history.
  
  8.
  Question: Many people argue that city life offers more benefits than life in the countryside.  
  Do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that living in cities is better than living in the countryside. I completely agree with this because cities offer more job opportunities and better access to services like healthcare and education.
  
  9.
  Question: High-ranking executives should receive the same salary as average workers within the company.  
  To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that top managers should be paid the same as regular workers. I completely agree with this because it would reduce income inequality and make workplaces feel fairer.
  
  10.
  Question: It has been suggested that cars and public transport should be banned from city centres, and only bicycles should be allowed.  
  To what extent do you agree or disagree?  

  Introduction: It is argued that city centres should only allow bicycles and ban all other vehicles. I completely agree with this because it would cut down on pollution and make city centres safer and quieter.

  **User’s Conclusion Opinion:**  
  "Cars and public transport should not be banned from city centres."
  
  ## Example Output:
  
  ### **Accuracy Check:**
  - **"Cars and public transport"** is a correct match for the original topic.  
  - **"Should not be banned"** accurately conveys disagreement, but sounds slightly generic. A stronger option could be **"must remain permitted in city centres"** for clarity and tone.  
  
  ### **Paraphrasing Extent:**
  - The user has restated the stance well, but the expression could be stronger and more formal.  
  - Overall paraphrasing is **acceptable**, with minor refinements possible.
  
  ---
  ### **Important Correction Based on Your Request:**  
  If a phrase in the user's conclusion is not a strong synonym or restatement, **do not suggest the original phrase from the introduction** as the replacement. Instead, suggest a more precise or natural alternative.
  
  For example:  
  - If the user writes **"carbon-based fuels"** for **"fossil fuels"**, do not suggest **"fossil fuels"**. Suggest something like **"non-renewable fuels"** or **"combustible energy sources"**.  
  - If the user writes **"clean power"** for **"renewable energy"**, do not suggest **"renewable energy"**. Suggest something like **"eco-friendly power"** or **"sustainable energy sources"**.

  Never ask the user if they want to revide or change their conclusion

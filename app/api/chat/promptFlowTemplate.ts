1. **Retrieve** the original component ({[original_component_key]}) and the user's paraphrased component ({[user_component_key]}).

- **"Businesses"** is an acceptable synonym for **"companies"**.
- **"fuels from the ground"** is a bit informal/wordy for **"fossil fuels"**. Consider **"non-renewable fuels"**.
- **"be increased tax"** is grammatically awkward for **"face higher taxes"**. Consider **"should pay higher taxes"** or **"should face increased taxation"**.
- **"green fuels"** is acceptable for **"renewable energy"**, although **"sustainable energy"** might sound slightly more formal.

2. **Analyze & Display Original:**
   - Retrieve the original component (e.g., from memory key {[original_component_key]}).
   - Output: "**Original Clause Order:**\n[Original Component Text]\n- Clause 1: [Text of first main clause]\n- Clause 2: [Text of second main clause]"
3. **Analyze & Display User's Version:**
   - Retrieve the user's version (e.g., from memory key {[user_component_key_for_clause_analysis]}).
   - Output: "\n**Your Clause Order:**\n[User's Component Text]\n- Clause 1: [Text of first main clause from user's text]\n- Clause 2: [Text of second main clause from user's text]"
4. **State Comparison Result:** Based on comparing the clauses, output either:
   - "**Comparison Result:** You have swapped the clause order compared to the original."
   - OR
   - "**Comparison Result:** You have kept the same clause order as the original."

## Completion Instructions:
- Replace \`[Component Being Analyzed]\` placeholder.

3. **If the user did NOT swap the clauses:**
   - Retrieve the user's version (e.g., from memory key {[user_component_key_for_clause_analysis]}).
   - Rewrite the user's sentence by correctly swapping the two main clauses, following grammatical rules (especially avoiding starting with unclear pronouns like 'Those'/'They' unless essential and clear).
   - Output *only* the reordered version, prefixed exactly like this:

## Rules for Reordering (Summary - full rules in promptsi.ts prompt 16):
- Swap only the two main clauses.
- Maintain original meaning and words as much as possible.
- Keep introductory phrases at the start.
- Handle comparative structures carefully.
- **Crucially: Do NOT start the reordered sentence with unclear pronouns (Those, They) unless the subject remains absolutely clear.**

## Task Instructions:
1. Retrieve the extracted ideas (e.g., from memory key {[user_extracted_ideas]}).
2. Evaluate each idea based on these criteria:
   - **Relevance:** Does it directly address/support the main point or answer the question?
   - **Specificity:** Is it clear and detailed enough, or too vague/generic?
   - **Conciseness:** Is it a short phrase (good) or a long explanation/full sentence (needs shortening for the intro/conclusion)?
3. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - If both ideas are strong (relevant, specific, concise), state this clearly.
   - If ideas are weak (vague, irrelevant, too long), explain *why* for each problematic idea.
   - **Suggest specific improvements or alternatives** for weak ideas.

## Example Output (Good Ideas):

**Evaluation:**
Both ideas ('reduces pollution', 'reduces traffic') are relevant, specific enough for this stage, and correctly formatted as short phrases. Well done.

## Example Output (Weak Ideas - Vague):

**Evaluation:**
- Idea 1 ('Public transport is a good idea'): This is too vague. It doesn't explain *why* it's good in the context of the question. Suggestion: Focus on a specific benefit like "improves accessibility".
- Idea 2 ('It helps people'): Also too vague. How does it help? Suggestion: Specify a benefit like "reduces travel costs for citizens".

## Example Output (Weak Ideas - Too Long):

**Evaluation:**
- Idea 1 ('Reducing air pollution by encouraging more people to use buses instead of cars'): This is too long and includes explanation. For an introduction/conclusion, simplify to just the core idea: "reducing air pollution".
- Idea 2 ('Decreasing traffic congestion, especially during rush hours, by making public transport more accessible'): Also too long. Simplify to: "decreasing traffic congestion".

1. Retrieve the user's submission (use the potentially corrected version if available, e.g., from memory key {[formula_corrected_version]} or else {[skill_user_input_displayed]}).
2. Analyze the text for:
   - **Logical Structure:** Does it follow the expected order of components (e.g., paraphrase -> opinion -> ideas)?
   - **Sentence Flow:** Do sentences connect smoothly, or are they abrupt/disconnected?
   - **Linking Words:** Are appropriate cohesive devices (e.g., 'because', 'and', 'however', 'therefore') used correctly and without unnecessary repetition? Are any missing?
   - **Clarity:** Is the relationship between ideas clear? Is there any redundancy?
3. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - If CC is strong, state this clearly and briefly explain why (e.g., "follows structure, clear links").
   - If there are issues, identify them specifically (e.g., "Ideas out of order", "Missing linking word between opinion and reasons", "Repetitive use of 'and'").
   - **Suggest specific improvements** to enhance flow or clarity (e.g., "Consider adding 'because' to link your opinion to your reasons.", "Try reordering sentence X to come before sentence Y.").

## Example Output (Good CC):

**Evaluation:**
Your [Skill Name] is well-structured and flows logically. The required components are in the correct order, and the ideas are clearly linked (e.g., using 'because').

## Example Output (Weak CC - Awkward Order/Links):

**Evaluation:**
- **Issue:** The opinion statement appears before the paraphrased question statement, disrupting the logical flow.
- **Issue:** The link between the opinion and the first reason is unclear. Consider adding 'because'.
- **Suggestion:** Start with "It is argued that...", then state your opinion using "I completely agree/disagree because...", followed by your reasons.

1. Retrieve the user's submission (use the formula-corrected version: {[formula_corrected_version]} or paraphrase-corrected version: {[paraphrase_corrected_version]} if available and relevant, otherwise use {[skill_user_input_displayed]}).
2. Analyze the text's vocabulary for:
   - **Range:** Is there a good variety of word choices, or is it repetitive? Are less common words used (correctly)?
   - **Accuracy:** Are words used with the correct meaning and form (e.g., noun vs. verb)? Are collocations natural?
   - **Appropriateness:** Is the vocabulary suitable for academic writing (avoiding informality, slang)? Is it precise?
3. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - If LR is strong, state this clearly and highlight positive examples (e.g., "Good use of synonyms like 'alleviates'").
   - If there are issues, identify them specifically (e.g., "Repetitive use of 'good'", "Incorrect word choice: 'disarray' instead of 'congestion'", "Informal phrase: 'get rid of'").
   - **Suggest specific, more appropriate alternative words or phrases** for any identified issues.

## Example Output (Good LR):

**Evaluation:**
Your vocabulary use is strong. You showed good range with words like 'alleviates' and 'minimizes', and your paraphrasing ('provided at no cost') was effective and appropriate.

## Example Output (Weak LR - Repetitive/Informal):

**Evaluation:**
- **Issue:** The word 'people' is repeated frequently. Consider alternatives like 'citizens', 'residents', 'individuals', or 'the public' depending on context.
- **Issue:** Phrases like 'good idea' and 'makes travel easier' are a bit basic. Consider more precise options like 'beneficial policy' or 'improves accessibility'.

2. Analyze the text for:
   - **Accuracy:** Identify errors in subject-verb agreement, tense, articles, prepositions, word forms, punctuation, etc.
   - **Range:** Assess the variety of sentence structures. Are there simple, compound, and complex sentences? Is the range limited or varied?
3. Provide structured feedback under an "Evaluation:" heading.
   - **Accuracy:** If errors are found, list them specifically, explain the error type briefly, and provide the corrected version of the phrase or sentence. (e.g., "- 'it make': Incorrect subject-verb agreement. Should be 'it makes'."). If no errors, state "No significant grammatical errors found."
   - **Range:** Comment on the variety of sentence structures used. (e.g., "Good use of complex sentences.", "Sentence structures are mostly simple; try incorporating conjunctions like 'while' or relative clauses like 'which...' to add variety.").

- **Accuracy:**
  - "- 'free to every citizens': Incorrect preposition/article and plural. Correction: 'free **for all** citizens'."
  - "- 'it make... and reduce': Verbs should agree/be parallel. Correction: 'it **makes**... and **reduces**...'"
